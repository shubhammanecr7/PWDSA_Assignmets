/*Q3. There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is
gas[i].You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs “cost[i]” of gas to travel from the
ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas
stations.Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can
travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a
solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
Example 1:
i/p : gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
o/p : 3
i/p : gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
o/p : -1

		for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
			// Add the gas and cost at each station to the total
			totalGas += gas[i];
			totalCost += cost[i];

		// If totalCost is greater than totalGas, it is not possible to complete the
